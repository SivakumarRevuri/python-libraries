Pandas:
    Pandas is a python module that makes data science easy and effective.

install: python -m pip install pandas

Introduction:
    1. High performance Data analysis tool
    2. working with large data set
    3. it supports/load files with different formats.
    4. more flexible to use.
    5. represents in tabular format(rows & columns).
    6. best suitable to work on missing data
    7. Indexing, slicing, subsetting the large data sets.
    8. we can merge or join two different data sets easily.
    9. we can also re-shape data sets.

==> 3 data strucutres
        a. Series: data represents in one dimensional e.g. List(arg)
        b. Data Frame: two dimensional e.g. list/dict/series/another data frame
        c. Panel: multi-dimensional e.g data, major axis, minor axis

import pandas as pd
pd.Series(data=, index=1)
pd.DataFrame(data=) ==> most efficient and dict data type is recommanded to use.
pd.Panel(data, majoraxis, minoraxis, dtype)

1. Process of cleaing messy data is called "data munging" or "data wrangling".
                (or)
    processing the raw data or structured/processed data

DataFrame:
    Dataframe is a main object in Pandas. It is used to represent the data with rows and columns(tabular format).
